! RoslynNUnitLight

The contents of this folder is from a project on GitHub called RoslynNUnitLight. This testing framework is used in the test suite for the UnityEngineAnalyzer project. 

UnityEngineAnalyzer is in the process of getting converted to use DotNet standard for future cross-platform compatibility. There is currently no version of the RoslynNUnitLight library available on NuGet that is compatible with DotNet Standard 2.0
